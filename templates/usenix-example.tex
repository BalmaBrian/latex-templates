\section*{\centering Abstract}
\vspace{-0.1in}
Your abstract text goes here. Just a few facts. Whet our appetites.
Not more than 200 words, if possible, and preferably closer to 150.

% Introduction section---------------------------------------------------------
\section{Introduction}
A paragraph of text goes here. Lots of text. Plenty of interesting
text. Text text text text text text text text text text text text text

More fascinating text. Features galore, plethora of promises.

% Footnotes, Verbatim, and Citations section-----------------------------------
\section{Footnotes, Verbatim, and Citations}
Footnotes should be places after puctuation characters, without any space 
between side characters and footnotes, like so.
\footnote{
    Remember that USENIX format stopped using endnotes and is not using regular
    footnotes.}
Ans some embedded literal code may look as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
        printf("Hello, World!\n");
        return 0;
    }
\end{verbatim}

Now we're going to cite some somebody. Watch for the cite tag. Here it comes.
Arpachi-Desseau and Arpachi-Dusseau coauthored an excellent OS book, which is 
also really funny~\cite{arpachiDusseau18:osbook}, and Waldsurger got into the 
SIGOPS hall-of-fame due to his seminal paper about resource management in the
ESX hypervisor~\cite{waldspurger02}.

The tilde character (\~{}) in the tex source means a non-breaking 
space. This way, your refrerences will always be attached to the word that 
preceded it, instead of going to the next line.

And the 'cite' package sorts your citations by their numerical order of the 
corresponding refrerences at the end of the paper, ridding you from the need 
to notice that, e.g, "Waldspurger" apprears after "Arpachi-Dusseau" when 
sorting refrerences alphabetically~
\cite{arpachiDusseau18:osbook, waldspurger02}.

It'd be nice and thoughtful of you to include a suitable link in each and 
every bibtex entry that you use in your submission, to allow reviewers 
(and other readers) to easily get to the cited work, as is done in all 
entries found in the References section of this document.

Now we're going take a look at Section~\ref{sec:figs}, but not before
observing that refs to sections and citations and such are colored and
clickable in the PDF because of the packages we've included.

% Figures section--------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Floating Figures and Lists}
\label{sec:figs}
%---------------------------
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[thin,gray!40] (-2,-2) grid (2,2);
  \draw[<->] (-2,0)--(2,0) node[right]{$x$};
  \draw[<->] (0,-2)--(0,2) node[above]{$y$};
  \draw[line width=2pt,blue,-stealth](0,0)--(1,1)
        node[anchor=south west]{$\boldsymbol{u}$};
  \draw[line width=2pt,red,-stealth](0,0)--(-1,-1)
        node[anchor=north east]{$\boldsymbol{-u}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig:vectors} Text size inside figure should be as big as
  caption's text. Text size inside figure should be as big as
  caption's text. Text size inside figure should be as big as
  caption's text. Text size inside figure should be as big as
  caption's text. Text size inside figure should be as big as
  caption's text. }
\end{figure}
%% %---------------------------

Here's a typical reference to a floating figure:
Figure~\ref{fig:vectors}. Floats should usually be placed where latex
wants then. Figure\ref{fig:vectors} is centered, and has a caption
that instructs you to make sure that the size of the text within the
figures that you use is as big as (or bigger than) the size of the
text in the caption of the figures. Please do. Really.

In our case, we've explicitly drawn the figure inlined in latex, to
allow this tex file to cleanly compile. But usually, your figures will
reside in some file.pdf, and you'd include them in your document
with, say, \textbackslash{}includegraphics.

Lists are sometimes quite handy. If you want to itemize things, feel
free:

\begin{description}
  
\item[fread] a function that reads from a \texttt{stream} into the
  array \texttt{ptr} at most \texttt{nobj} objects of size
  \texttt{size}, returning returns the number of objects read.

\item[Fred] a person's name, e.g., there once was a dude named Fred
  who separated usenix.sty from this file to allow for easy
  inclusion.
\end{description}

\noindent
The noindent at the start of this paragraph in its tex version makes
it clear that it's a continuation of the preceding paragraph, as
opposed to a new paragraph in its own right.

% LaTeX-ing Your TeX File------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{LaTeX-ing Your .tex File}
People often use \texttt{pdflatex} these days for creating pdf-s from
tex files via the shell. And \texttt{bibtex}, of course. Works for us.

% Acknowledgments section------------------------------------------------------
\section*{Acknowledgments}
The USENIX latex style is old and very tired, which is why
there's no \textbackslash{}acks command for you to use when
acknowledging. Sorry.

% Availability section---------------------------------------------------------
\section*{Availability}
USENIX program committees give extra points to submissions that are
backed by artifacts that are publicly available. If you made your code
or data available, it's worth mentioning this fact in a dedicated
section.
