% Info on CCS & Keywords-------------------------------------------------------
\section{\MakeUppercase{What are the CCS Concepts \& Keywords?}}
The ACM Computing Classification System (CCS) is a system that allows authors 
to classify their work. The CCS is hierarchical, and authors are asked to 
select the CCS concepts that are most relevant to their work. A full list 
of CCS concepts and their descriptions can be found at 
\url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs_flat.cfm}.


Keywords are a list of terms that are relevant to your work. They are used 
for indexing and searching for your work. A good set of keywords will help 
others find your work. Keywords should be separated by semicolons and end 
with a period.

% Sections---------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{\MakeUppercase{Sections}}
Sections are numbered, and the numbering is displayed. Top level sections must 
be in all caps. Subsections are also numbered and displayed. Subsubsections 
are also numbered and displayed. Subsections \& subsubsections don't need to
be in all caps.

% Footnotes, Verbatim, and Citations section-----------------------------------
\section{\MakeUppercase{Footnotes, Verbatim, and Citations}}
Footnotes should be places after puctuation characters, without any space 
between side characters and footnotes, like so.
\footnote{
    Remember that USENIX format stopped using endnotes and is not using regular
    footnotes.}
Ans some embedded literal code may look as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
        printf("Hello, World!\n");
        return 0;
    }
\end{verbatim}

Now we're going to cite some somebody. Watch for the cite tag. Here it comes.
Arpachi-Desseau and Arpachi-Dusseau coauthored an excellent OS book, which is 
also really funny~\cite{test}, and Waldsurger got into the 
SIGOPS hall-of-fame due to his seminal paper about resource management in the
ESX hypervisor~\cite{test}.
